In this project i will make a android game where 2 random numbers will be shown on the screen and the user has to pick the big numbers between the two numbers shown. If the user picks the bigger number the background colour of the screen wil turn green and popup message displaying "Correct" will be shown . If the user picks the wrong number the background colour will change to red and a popup message of Incorrect will be shown . Nothing just a basic project to learn some basic concepts of Android development. Hope you like it
